LOCATION PERMISSION FLOW
===========================================

When user asks a location-based question:

```
User taps: "What's near me?"
         ↓
Check: STATE.userLocation exists?
         ↓
    ┌────┴────┐
    ↓         ↓
   YES        NO
    ↓         ↓
 Show      Show message:
 nearby    "I need your location
 mics      to find nearby mics"
 sorted         ↓
 by        [Allow Location] button
 distance       ↓
           User taps
                ↓
           getUserLocation()
                ↓
           Show results
```

Questions that trigger this flow:
- What's near me?
- What's closest to me?
- What's under 15/30/45/60 min away?
- Something closer
- Cheap mics near me?
- Free mics I can walk to?
- Easiest to get to from here?

Code pattern:
```javascript
function handleLocationQuestion(question) {
  if (STATE.userLocation) {
    // Already have location - answer immediately
    return answerWithLocation(question);
  } else {
    // Need permission first
    return {
      message: "I need your location to find nearby mics",
      buttons: [{
        label: "Allow Location",
        action: async () => {
          await getUserLocation();
          if (STATE.userLocation) {
            return answerWithLocation(question);
          } else {
            return "Location access denied. Try searching by borough instead.";
          }
        }
      }, {
