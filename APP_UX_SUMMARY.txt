MICMAP UX SUMMARY
=================

THREE PHASES OF USER JOURNEY
----------------------------

PHASE 1: DISCOVERY (Where am I / Where will I be?)
- User opens app
- Enters current location OR future location (e.g., "I'll be in Brooklyn at 7pm")
- Problem: Current search bar not intuitive for this
- Need: Clear prompt like "Where are you starting from?"

PHASE 2: DECISION (Which mic should I go to?)
- App calculates commute times to ALL mics from user's location
- Uses real-time subway data + backend routing
- User browses mics sorted by commute time, filters by day/time
- User picks a mic
- Decision phase complete

PHASE 3: COMMUTE (How do I get there?)
- User needs turn-by-turn directions
- Two options: Keep in-app OR hand off to Google Maps


THE AD REVENUE QUESTION
-----------------------

Question: If I hand off to Google Maps for directions, do I lose ad revenue?

Answer: Yes, technically - but it's more nuanced.

STAY IN-APP (build your own navigation):
Pros:
- More time in app = more ad impressions
- Full control of user experience
- Can show ads during navigation

Cons:
- MASSIVE engineering effort (months of work)
- Battery drain concerns
- Users will compare you unfavorably to Google Maps
- Navigation bugs = users uninstall your app
- You're competing with Google's core product

HAND OFF TO GOOGLE MAPS:
Pros:
- Zero engineering effort
- Better user experience (Google Maps is excellent)
- Users trust it, know how to use it
- You focus on what makes your app unique (mic discovery)

Cons:
- User leaves your app during commute (15-45 min)
- Fewer ad impressions per session

THE REAL MATH:
- Average session with handoff: User spends 3-5 min in your app choosing a mic
- Average session with in-app nav: User spends 3-5 min choosing + 20 min navigating

But consider:
- Users who have bad navigation experience = uninstall
- Users who have good experience = come back multiple times per week
- 10 good sessions > 1 long frustrating session

RECOMMENDATION:
Hand off to Google Maps. Here's why:

1. Your VALUE is in Phase 1 & 2 (discovery + decision)
   - Nobody else aggregates open mics with real-time transit
   - That's your competitive advantage, not navigation

2. Ad revenue strategy:
   - Show ads on the mic list page (high attention)
   - Show ad on mic detail page before they leave
   - Show "return to MicMap" prompt after their mic ends
   - Build loyalty so they open your app 3-4x per week

3. Future monetization beyond ads:
   - Promoted mic listings (venues pay to be featured)
   - "Pro" version with no ads
   - Ticket sales commission
   - Venue partnerships

4. The 80/20 rule:
   - 20% of effort (discovery + decision) = 80% of value
   - 80% of effort (navigation) = 20% of value
   - Don't build what Google already perfected


IMMEDIATE UX FIXES NEEDED
-------------------------

1. PHASE 1 - Location Entry:
   Current: Generic search bar, not clear what to enter
   Fix: Clear prompt "Where are you?" with:
        - "Use my current location" button (prominent)
        - "Or enter an address" text input
        - Maybe: "Where will you be later?" for future planning

2. PHASE 2 - Transit Calculation:
   Current: Manual trigger?
   Fix: Auto-calculate on location entry
        - Show loading state while calculating
        - Sort mics by commute time by default
        - Real-time subway data integration (already built?)

3. PHASE 3 - Handoff:
   Current: ?
   Fix: "Get Directions" button on mic detail
        - Opens Google Maps with destination pre-filled
        - Link format: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=ADDRESS&travelmode=transit
        - Consider Apple Maps for iOS users


SUMMARY
-------
Don't build navigation. Build the best mic discovery + transit time calculator.
Hand off to Google Maps for the actual commute.
Make money from ads during discovery phase + venue partnerships.
Users will come back repeatedly if Phase 1 & 2 are excellent.
